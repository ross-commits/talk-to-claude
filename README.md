# CallMe

**Claude Code Plugin** - Claude calls you on the phone when it needs your input or wants to report progress.

## Why CallMe?

You start Claude on a complex task and walk away. Maybe you're making coffee, taking a meeting, or stepping out for lunch. With CallMe, Claude can reach you when it matters - no need to keep checking your terminal.

### Example Scenarios

**Long-running migrations**
> "I'm running the database migration. It'll take about 30 minutes. Go grab lunch - I'll call you when it's done or if something goes wrong."

**Architecture decisions mid-task**
> "I've been refactoring the auth system and found two approaches: we could use JWT with refresh tokens, or switch to session-based auth. Each has trade-offs. Want me to call you to discuss?"

**Blocked by unclear requirements**
> "I'm implementing the payment flow but the spec doesn't cover what happens when a card is declined. I'll call you to clarify before proceeding."

**Multi-step deployments**
> "Deployment to staging is complete and tests are passing. Ready to push to production - calling you for the go-ahead."

**Research complete, ready for review**
> "I've analyzed the three API options you mentioned. I have a recommendation but want to walk you through the trade-offs. Calling now."

### How It Changes Your Workflow

Without CallMe:
1. Start Claude on a task
2. Keep checking terminal every few minutes
3. Context switch repeatedly
4. Miss the moment Claude needs input
5. Waste time waiting

With CallMe:
1. Start Claude on a task
2. Do other work (or take a break)
3. Phone rings when Claude needs you
4. Quick conversation, back to your day
5. Claude continues autonomously

## How It Works

```
Claude Code                    CallMe MCP Server (local)
    │                                    │
    │  "I finished the feature..."       │
    ▼                                    ▼
Plugin ────stdio──────────────────► MCP Server
                                         │
                                         ├─► ngrok tunnel
                                         │
                                         ▼
                                   Phone Provider (Telnyx/Twilio)
                                         │
                                         ▼
                                   Your Phone rings
                                   You speak
                                   Text returns to Claude
```

The MCP server runs locally and automatically creates an ngrok tunnel for phone provider webhooks.

## Tools

### `initiate_call`
Start a phone call.

```typescript
const { callId, response } = await initiate_call({
  message: "Hey! I finished the auth system. What should I work on next?"
});
```

### `continue_call`
Continue with follow-up questions.

```typescript
const response = await continue_call({
  call_id: callId,
  message: "Got it. Should I add rate limiting too?"
});
```

### `speak_to_user`
Speak to the user without waiting for a response. Useful for acknowledging requests before time-consuming operations.

```typescript
await speak_to_user({
  call_id: callId,
  message: "Let me search for that information. Give me a moment..."
});
// Continue with your long-running task
const results = await performSearch();
// Then continue the conversation
const response = await continue_call({
  call_id: callId,
  message: `I found ${results.length} results...`
});
```

### `end_call`
End the call.

```typescript
await end_call({
  call_id: callId,
  message: "Perfect, I'll get started. Talk soon!"
});
```

## When Claude Calls You

- **Task completed** - Status report, asking what's next
- **Decision needed** - Architecture, technology choices
- **Blocked** - Needs clarification to continue

Claude won't call for simple yes/no questions.

## Costs

| Service | Telnyx | Twilio |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Outbound calls | ~$0.007/min | ~$0.014/min |

- **Text-to-speech**: ~$0.02/min (TTS)

**Total**: ~$0.03-0.04/minute of conversation

## Troubleshooting

### Claude doesn't use the tool
1. Check all required environment variables are set (ideally in `~/.claude/settings.json`)
2. Restart Claude Code after installing the plugin
3. Try explicitly: "Call me to discuss the next steps when you're done."

### Call doesn't connect
1. Check the MCP server logs (stderr) with `claude --debug`
2. Verify your phone provider credentials are correct
3. Make sure ngrok can create a tunnel

### Audio issues
1. Ensure your phone number is verified with your provider
2. Check that the webhook URL in your provider dashboard matches your ngrok URL

### ngrok errors
1. Verify your `CALLME_NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` is correct
2. Check if you've hit ngrok's free tier limits
3. Try a different port with `CALLME_PORT=3334`
